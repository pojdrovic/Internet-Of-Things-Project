# Internet-Of-Things-Project
This is the final project for the EC450 Microprocessors class. We built an Internet of Things system, simulating its uses in a smart home environment. 

The MSPHome Thermostat is a small IoT device that emulates the control of an actual HVAC system with cooling, heating, and steady state functionality. It features a web based portal that allows for controlling the home temperature, simulate temperature fluctiations inside the home, and visually see via a web browser the current state and temperature inside the home.
